            <p>I spent my first new year's with a friend. We didn't do much but what we
                did was memorable. I set a goal that I'm planning to adhere to - 
               2500kms on foot this year. Christmas was a memorable one too with my 
               first unexpected gift - two tubes of sunscreen - helping me become even more of a creep. I also 
               gave my first actual gift, a single Dark Fantasy cookie, without the 
               compulsion or advice of my parents. It was a lot of fun to mess with my 
               friends and convince them that I've been with a woman ðŸ˜‚.</p>
